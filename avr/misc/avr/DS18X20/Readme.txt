This code is a DS18X20 1 wire temperature sensor driver 
The code is compatible with the varius releases of gcc (tested from ver 3 and up)
and it is implemented as close to the DS18X20 datasheet as possible.
The driver presented here works fine to my knowledge.

Feel free to modify it if you wish but give me a note if you wish
so i can find out if anything is wrong.

I hope it can help someone.
Chris.
