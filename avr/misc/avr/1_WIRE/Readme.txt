I searched for a 1 WIRE driver but found almost nothing for Gcc
so i decided to write my own.
The code presented here is compatible with the varius releases of gcc
For usage help have a look at the DS18X20 driver (ds1820.c)
This code follows as close as possible the 1 wire protocoll.

Feel free to modify it if you wish but give me a note if you wish
so i know what i did wrong.

I hope it can help someone.
Chris.
