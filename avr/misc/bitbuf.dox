/** \defgroup bitbuf bitbuf: Generic Bit-Buffer Structure and Function Library

	This bit-buffer structure provides an easy and efficient way to store and
	process bits. You can create as many bit buffers as you like (within memory
	limits), and then use this common set of functions to access each buffer.
	Supported functions include sequential getting and storing of bits,
	array-like get, buffer flush (dump data), and reset-to-beginning.
	This buffer is not dynamically allocated, it has a user-defined fixed 
	maximum size.
