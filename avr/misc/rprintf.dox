/** \defgroup rprintf rprintf: printf() Function Library (for general and specific data types)

The rprintf function library provides a simplified (reduced) version of the common C printf() function.  See the code files for details about which printf features are supported.  Also in this library are a variety of functions for fast printing of certain common data types (variable types).  Functions include print string from RAM, print string from ROM, print string snippet, print hex byte/short/long, and a custom-formatted number print.

\note All output from the rprintf library can be directed to any device or software which accepts characters.  This means that rprintf output can be sent to the UART (serial port) or can be used with the LCD display libraries to print formatted text on the screen.
