/** \defgroup ata ata: IDE/ATA Interface Driver

(for IDE/ATA hard disks and CF Cards)

This library provides an interface from AVR processors to IDE/ATA hard disks.  The library supports automatic drive identification and sector-level reading and writing.  Some minimal address decoding hardware is required to use this interface.  A schematic of the interface is coming.  Future revisions may include a direct hardware-less option.
