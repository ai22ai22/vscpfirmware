Display3000 based VSCP Demo and Learning course,
the total noob to VSCP and CAN right now...

Requirements:
-------------
- two display3000-boards such like this (D071 in my case with CAN/RS485):
  http://display3000.de/html/microcontroller1.html
- latest WinAVR suite (20080610)
- any working ISP progger
- moderate C-knowlegde
- plenty of time

Aims:
-----
- writing anything down to get a nice noob's-manual for Wiki/CVS
  it's needed urgently and could possibly only be written by total
  newbees.... ;)
- getting first At90Can128-device to run as RS232-CAN-Interface
- getting second AT90CAN128-device to run as pure VSCP slave node
- slave sends a measurement every second to all devices
- Interface captures all messages and displays in VSCPworks
- slave reacts to simple switch-on events from VSCPworks with LED
- interface also displays recieved measurements and commands
- done

Status:
-------
Currently this thing is working, it makes nick discovery, responds
to PROBE, and accepts and displays measurements for current and
temperature both as signed integer, current ranging from 0....2^22,
temperature ranging from 0...1023 with 169 beeing 0°C (I put the LM60
directly to AVR-ADC with internal reference 2.56V which gives 0.4K per
digit resolution). Calibration is so far hard wired and will be
programmable in future. In real application this probe will send out
intensity measurements and temperature is only bonus as it gets used
for internal compensations for which it must not be calibrated itself.

Problems:
---------
Licence of Display3000 provided display control lib does not allow to
upload to SVN, need to get GPL display lib for this thing.

Of course, if you buy a display3000 module, you automatically own the missing
files, just copy them into the project folder.
