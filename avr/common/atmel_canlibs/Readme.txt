This directory contains the following libraries supplied by atmel.

atmel_at90canXXX_canlib_1.1_2003.7z
-----------------------------------
This ist version 1.1 of that library, year 2003. The mating license file
seem to be lost. Sorry. This Lib is no longer available from Atmel.
I have zipped it to clean up the repo a little bit, but didnt want to sweep it.
There is no known reference to these files throughout the repo.
It was formerly found in the path /firmware/common/at90can128.

atmel_at90canXXX_canlib_3.2_2007.7z
-----------------------------------
This ist version 3.2 of that library, year 2007. It contains the library folder
but the examples have been stripped out for size reasons.
The complete archive can be found here:

http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3795
http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/at90CANLIB_3_2.zip

The can-lib itself is in the lib_mcu folder. The other 2 folders are
support files for Atmels DVK90CAN1 development board.
More info can be found by searching on atmels site, tools section,
for DVK90CAN1 or maybe here
http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc4381.pdf

If somebody wants to have parts of this as source in the repo feel
free to extract what you need.
I want to suggest to put either only the /mmcu_lib/can folder right here
or if really needed the complete /mcu_lib folder also in this place.
