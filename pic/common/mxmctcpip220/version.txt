Modtronix TCP/IP Stack
********************
The Modtronix TCP/IP Stack is a modified version of the original Micorchip TCP/IP Stack.
The licence of the original code still applies, see license.txt file!

********************
V2.20 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 May 10 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v220)
********************
- Fixed problem in MAC Receive buffer where large TCP and UDP packets that crossed MAC
  Receive buffer boundry got corrupted.
- Fixed minimum length check in Ethernet packet - caused CRC error
- Added PIC configuration to main file - removed c18cfm.asm file
- Added configuration to mac.c to disable INT0 output of RTL8019AS. When disabled,
  PIC port pin RB0 is tri-state, and can be used by user.
- Modified TCPProcess() to include localIP as third param. This was done to
  allow this function to calculate checksum correctly.
- Added UDPChecksum logic in UDPProcess()
- Modified UDPProcess() and FindMatchingSocket() to include localIP as new parameter.
  This corrects pseudo header checksum logic in UDPProcess().
  It also corrects broadcast packet matching correct in FindMatchingSocket().
- Moved some defines from dhcp.h and dhcp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from ftp.h and ftp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from http.h and http.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from ip.h and ip.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from snmp.h and snmp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from tcp.h and tcp.c to projdefs.h

********************
V2.10 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 March 01 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v210)
********************
- Cleaned up includes at top of each file. Each *.h file includes projdefs.h as first
  include. Each *.c file includes it's *.h file as first include.

********************
V2.00 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 Jan 19 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v200)
********************
- Made major changes to the original stack. All project specific defines have been moved
  from stack files to the projdefs.h file
- Changed the callback funcitions HTTPGetVar() and HTTPExecGetCmd() in http module.
