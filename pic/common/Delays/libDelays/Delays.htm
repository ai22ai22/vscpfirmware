<H1><B>      for fedC and wizC</B></H1>
<H2>NAME</H2>
     <B>MCC18 compatible Delays - Burn CPU-cycles</B>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;delays.h&gt;</B>

     <B>void Delay1TCY( void );</B>
     <B>void Delay10TCYx( unsigned char unit );</B>
     <B>void Delay100TCYx( unsigned char unit );</B>
     <B>void Delay1KTCYx( unsigned char unit );</B>
     <B>void Delay10KTCYx( unsigned char unit );</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
     <B>Delay1TCY()</B> delays execution for one instruction cycle. It is implemented
     as a macro.

     <B>Delay10TCYx()</B> delays execution for multiples of 10 instruction cycles that
     is specified in <B>unit</B>. A value of 1 to 255 provides 10 to 2550 Tcy delay.
     A value of 0 will provide a delay of 2560 Tcy.
    
     <B>Delay100TCYx()</B> delays execution for multiples of 100 instruction cycles that
     is specified in <B>unit</B>. A value of 1 to 255 provides 100 to 25,500 Tcy delay.
     A value of 0 will provide a delay of 25,600 Tcy.

     <B>Delay1KTCYx()</B> delays execution for multiples of 1,000 instruction cycles that
     is specified in <B>unit</B>. A value of 1 to 255 provides 1,000 to 255,000 Tcy delay.
     A value of 0 will provide a delay of 256,000 Tcy.

     <B>Delay10KTCYx()</B> delays execution for multiples of 10,000 instruction cycles that
     is specified in <B>unit</B>. A value of 1 to 255 provides 10,000 to 2,550,000 Tcy delay.
     A value of 0 will provide a delay of 2,560,000 Tcy.

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>
     The macro's and functions in this library do not return a value.

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>
     #include &lt;delays.h&gt;

     Delay100TCYx(12);     // Delay 100 * 12 = 1200 cycles

<H2>NOTES</H2>
     The library only supports MCU's of the PIC18 family. An error is flagged when
     the library is used with non-PIC18 MCU's.

     When QuickCall is disabled, <B>Delay10TCYx()</B> is less accurate. Because,
     for PIC18, QuickCall is very likely to be enabled, this should not matter much.
     A warning is given when <B>Delay10TCYx()</B> is used while QuickCall is disabled.

     Including <B>delays.h</B> automatically includes the standard FED delays library
     as well.

<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>
     No configuration is required.
