SMART 2 - Build
===============


There are two project files for this project. One the debug version is intended for testing 
and debugging with the Microchip ICD and the other is for release. In the release version 
the code has been reallocated above the bootloader and the bootloader should be in place for
it to work properly.

There are two ways to prepare a device.

1.) Combine the release and bootloader hex files and burn the chip.  

2.) With the bootloader on the chip replace the firmware with the VSCP bootloading software.
