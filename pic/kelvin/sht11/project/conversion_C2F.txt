To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius use the following formula:

Tc = (5/9)*(Tf-32); Tc = temperature in degrees Celsius, Tf = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit

For example, suppose you have a Fahrenheit temperature of 98.6 degrees and you wanted to 
convert it into degrees Celsius. Using the above formula, you would first subtract 32 from 
the Fahrenheit temperature and get 66.6. Then you multiply 66.6 by five-ninths and get 37 
degrees Celsius.

The formula to convert a Celsius temperature into degrees Fahrenheit is:

Tf = (9/5)*Tc+32; Tc = temperature in degrees Celsius, Tf = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit

For example, suppose you have a Celsius temperature of 100 degrees and you want to convert it 
into degrees Fahrenheit. Using the above formula, you first multiply the Celsius temperature 
reading by nine-fifths and get 180. Then you add 32 to 180 and get 212 degrees Fahrenheit.


For our usage:

100 * tf = ( 9 * tc + 16000 ) / 5

where tf is 100 * temp in Fahrenheit.
and tc 100 * temp in celsius.

Other way around

100 * tc  = ( 5 * tf - 16000 ) / 9
