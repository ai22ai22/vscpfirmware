Ämne: Re: [EE:] Smartest binary way to detect current or no current in a
cable

Are you actually trying to detect current in the cable or would voltage be
OK?

The simplist way to detect AC  voltage is to wrap wire over the cable for
about 100mm or so . This will have a capacitance to the live conductor as
well as the neutral & earth conductors. So a voltage divider is formed -
at quite high impedance. But a couple of diodes to clip the voltage and a
connection to an input port are all that is required to detect if the
circuit is "live" or "dead". Isolation is provided by the cable sheath an
wire insulation so there is no worries here. You need an earth connection
to your detector however.

If you really need to detect current, then a simple magnetic detector is
probably the easiset. e.g a single or 1/2 turn  though a core with secondry
of many turns & a load resistor. It does mean you have to split the cable
however to separate the go & return paths.
Placing a rod type  magnetic core with 100+ turns (e.g a nail with wire
wrapped around it !) next to the feed cable may work, depending on a number
of factors, but may not be reliable either, it will depend on cable
construction, current level, length of core, number of turns... etc. I
haven't tryed this but have used the voltage detect version above.

What is the smartest and lowest cost method to detect if there is a
current flowing in a 110/220 V cable, preferably without doing any thing
else with the wire then to attach something outside of the cable.
