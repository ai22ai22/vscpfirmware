Ämne: RE: [1-wire]Measuring sunlight

Dear Stephan - Dan Awtrey (a Staff Engineer, Dallas Semiconductor), wrote
this in the article, May 2001 - 1-Wire Addressable Digital Instruments (see
Dan's comments below).

This should also work:  http://www.photonicdetectors.com/pdf/pdbv113.pdf

Here is Dan Awtrey's article:

Ref: http://www.sensorsmag.com/articles/0501/34/main.shtml

"An interesting variation of a solar radiation sensor can be constructed
using a standard LED in reverse bias mode. An LED is selected that generates
acceptable photocurrent levels when exposed to the sun at high noon on a
clear day. The resistor is sized to develop 250 mV maximum using the
formula:

Rsens = E/I

where:

E = 0.25 V
I = maximum photocurrent generated


One example is the EFA5364X from Stanley (Irvine, CA). This is a
super-bright orange AlGaInP LED with a peak response at 609 nm and a narrow
(15°) spectral field of view. A 4.7 k sense resistor provides acceptable
outdoor performance, which may be increased to 100 k if the circuit is to be
used with indoor lighting. LEDs made from other compounds will have their
peak response in a different portion of the spectrum, which can prove useful
in certain installations."

In the same article from Dan, you can use a solar cell... BUT (cymbal crash
goes here!):

Let me also suggest, that the DS2450 1-WireTM Quad A/D Converter (4 ADC
Channels), is a good choice also, in that you can "look" East, West", and
"Staight-Up", for sunrise, sunset, and high-noon sensing, with a silcon
solar cell.

I use this, from Radio Shack:

Ref:  http://www.radioshack.com/search.asp?find=solar+cell&site=search&SRC=1

I use catalog number:  277-1201

Ref:
http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&product%5Fid=277-1
201

Its small, has a plastic case (put some water-proofing "goop" around the
edge of the platic lens to keep the rain out!), and is very sensitive.

This one, is $12.99...

878

You might want to keep an eye on what Systronix is doing, for their LCX
(Java Control Systems)product line at:

http://jcx.systronix.com/

I have a "preview" JCX product running on a DalSemi "TINI-type" product
(actually a Systronix TStik), that uses the DS2450 ADC, that allows for
monitoring light levels over the WWW.

The target market for the JCX products are intended for the JStik, at:

http://jstik.systronix.com/specs.htm

Anyway, "Let there be LIGHT!"  I hope this helps.

Best regards, Kelly Smith

Subject: [1-wire]Measuring sunlight


Hello,

I want to measure sunlight with a 1-wire based approach. The circuit with to
OP-954 should do it. But I  can't find a distributor for the OP-954 in
Germany. Has anybody a circuit containing an other photodiode?

Regards,

Stephan
