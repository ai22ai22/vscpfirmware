    nslib 0.1 - Netslate Development Library

    http://celab21.pc.elec.uq.edu.au/~ben/netslate/nslib-0.1.tar.gz


Description:

	This is the README for nslib version 0.1, a library for the ARM7500-
	based Netslate Development Board.  More information on the Netslate
	project at the University of Queensland, Australia, is available at:

		http://celab21.pc.elec.uq.edu.au/~ben/netslate/
	or
		http://www.elec.uq.edu.au/~marks/

	The files in this distribution build libns-0.1.a, a library of
	general purpose routines including simple exception handling,
	interrupt dispatching, heap management, and interfaces to video
	display, mouse and serial port.

	There is a lot of work to be done on this library before it is
	really up to scratch, but it has served its purpose for the
	Netslate project and I hope it can be of use to other people
	starting out with the ARM7500.

Installation:

	To use this library, you will need the GNU gcc and gas packages,
	and the semilib library from ARM.  I use gcc 2.6.3 and gas 2.5.2,
	both configured with arm-semi-aout targets.  Copies of these
	distributions are available from the same ftp site as nslib, above.

	You will need to edit the Makefile to suit your site.  Note that
	a small start file crt0.S comes with this library, containing
	the exception vector table when linking straight to a ROM image.
	You may not wish to overwrite the crt0.o installed by semilib.  You
	will probably need to make other arrangements to call the exception
	handlers if you are using a debug monitor etc.

Usage:

	It goes without saying that this package is written specifically
	for the Netslate hardware.  Unless you happen to have access to
	the Netslate prototype (of which there is only one) you will
	need to make various changes to make the library work with your
	hardware.

	It is more likely that the various functions and modules will
	be useful as guides to writing your own code for the ARM7500
	I/O subsystems.  The thesis report document describes each
	of the modules and how it works.

Acknowledgements:

	Portions of the serial port and interrupt dispatch modules are
	based on code from Marco Graziano's port to the ARM600 of
	Jean Labrosse's uC/OS kernel, available at
