This version updated to be conform with all current 
errata sheets.

This example program implements a set of CAN drivers for the 
Philips LPC2000 ARM7 derivatives with CAN interfaces.

This driver does not make usage of the hardware acceptance
filters, it receives ALL CAN messages on the bus.
			
Tested with Keil's "DKARMg" tool set and the 
MCB2100 Development Board: www.keil.com/mcb2100
